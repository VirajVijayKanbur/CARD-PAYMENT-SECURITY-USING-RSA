In most cases, we use our PIN to make transactions in ATM's. But what if we have lost our credit card and accidentally a person knows our PIN?
Thus, in this project, a person can basically enter two large prime numbers on the screen of the ATM machine and the machine will generate a decrypted private key via the RSA Algorithm, after which that private key is sent to the user via SMS. So, this acts as an additional security measure to the pre-existing PIN.
